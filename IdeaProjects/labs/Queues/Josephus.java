/*
 * Name:
 *
 * Description: Josephus problem.
 * In the Josephus problem from antiquity, n people are in dire straits and agree to the following strategy
 * to reduce the population. They arrange themselves in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to nâˆ’1)
 * and proceed around the circle, eliminating every mth person until only one person is left.
 * Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated.
 * Write a program that takes two integer command-line arguments m and n and
 * prints the order in which people are eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
 *
 * Algorithm: Use a queue to model the circle.
 *  -- Take out the first m - 1 entries and add to back of the queue
 *      -- then mth entry is eliminated.
 *  -- Repeat until the queue has one entry
