# cs1
Repository for the CS1 course I am teaching.  This has a sample project "code", with a setup for intelliJ (which includes a template for class homework/projects), and some data files/stdlib.jar.  

To use this repository:

1. Clone this to your laptop.
2. Open the project "code" in intelliJ
3. You can then create new classes in "code"
